To solve the n-puzzle problem, I implemented two algorithms: A* and bidirectional A*.
For both algorithms, I used a heuristic function that combines Manhattan Distance with Linear Conflict, which is used to compute an estimate of the cost to solve a puzzle.
The A* algorithm I implemented solves the problem in reasonable time only for a size not exceeding 3x3.
On the other hand, the bidirectional A* algorithm solves the problem in reasonable time up to a size of 4x4.
